We are Middle Ambient Studios, an indie developer studio created for the purpose of making 
our first game ever for the university UPC (CITM).

We decided to recreate PANG, an arcade videogame from 1989, where you have to destroy
all balloons in the screen.

Description of the game:

PANG is an arcade videogame from 1989, your mission is to destroy all balloons in the screen. The balloons
will bounce without stop until you destroy them with your harpoon. Each time you destroy a balloon and it's
big enough, it will split into two smaller ballons, this can happen up to 3 times if the first balloon you hit is 
a very big one. The game follows a very linear path, each stage is divided in 3 levels, each level has it's own
balloons and you have to always destroy them to progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Controls:

To move the player to the left press A and to move the player to the right press D.

To shot the harpoon (Or the equiped weapon) press SPACE BAR.

To advance in the different cutscenes or the intro scene to play, press ENTER.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to play the game:

You will start in the easiest stage with 1 balloon, your mission is to always destroy all balloons in the screen.
The balloons will bounce without stop until you destroy them with your harpoon, each time you hit a balloon with
your harpoon, the balloon will split into two smaller balloons (up to three times depending on the size of the 
current balloon being destroyed). 

Some balloons will drop items, which can help the player boost his weapons or make his progression easier.

Each time you destroy a balloon of the same size, you start a streak for that balloon's size, giving you extra
points.

Be carefull with the time, you have a lot of time to kill all the balloons but it's not unlimited! When the time 
reaches 0, you will lose. Completing the game with a lot of time left, will give the player extra points.

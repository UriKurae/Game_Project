### DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME

PANG is an arcade videogame from 1989, your mission is to destroy all balloons in the screen. The balloons
will bounce without stop until you destroy them with your harpoon. Each time you destroy a balloon and it's
big enough, it will split into two smaller ballons, this can happen up to 3 times if the first balloon you hit is 
a very big one. The game follows a very linear path, each stage is divided in 3 levels, each level has it's own
balloons and you have to always destroy them to progress.

### OUR OBJECTIVE

We are Middle Ambient Studios, an indie developer studio created for the purpose of making 
our first game ever for the university UPC (CITM).

We decided to recreate PANG, an arcade videogame from 1989, where you have to destroy
all balloons in the screen.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME

PANG is an arcade videogame from 1989, your mission is to destroy all balloons in the screen. The balloons
will bounce without stop until you destroy them with your harpoon. Each time you destroy a balloon and it's
big enough, it will split into two smaller ballons, this can happen up to 3 times if the first balloon you hit is 
a very big one. The game follows a very linear path, each stage is divided in 3 levels, each level has it's own
balloons and you have to always destroy them to progress.
